# CTST Archived Points Rankings

The latest archived CTST documents for the Men's and Lady's Points Leaders dated November 20, 2019.

Only the documents for the 2019 points season have been located so far. These documents are now redundant, since the new CTST database constructed from the Points Registry data can be used to generate points ranking for each year.
