# CTST Archived Points Registry

The latest archived CTST Points Registry documents, dated Jan 14, 2020.

These documents are the primary source of data used to construct the CTST Points Database for all events up to Jan 2020.

There are two documents, one PDF file each for Men's Points and Women's Points.

Each of these documents is copied to the `create_csv_from_archive` directory, where scripts are run to extact the points data and generate a CSV file containing combined data for all leaders and followers. This combined data is for the legacy data only (up to Jan 2020). The legacy data CSV file is copied to the `create_csv_new` directory where it is combined with
data from the post-2020 events to form the master database.

Note that these documents were created by the CTST from the information provided to the CTST by each Event Director.
None of these CTST documents themselves constitute the "official" contest scores, and there may be errors/omissions therein.
