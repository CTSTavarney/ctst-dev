# CTST Archived Event Result Documents

This folder contains both the legacy CTST event result documents up to January, 2020,
as well as all subsequent CTST events.

There were 113 CTST events from 2012 through 2020. 111 event result files have been located so far.

The following 2 event result documents are missing:

- 2012 Colorado Country Classic
- 2016 San Diego Dance Festival

The legacy (up to 2020) event result documents were NOT used to construct the CTST database, since there are missing files, and the 111 files are in several different formats, making it more difficult to use an automated solution to extract the data. Instead the two (Men's and Lady's) Points Registry PDF files were used.

For events after 2020, the event data (entry sheets/score sheets, etc.) provided to the CTST by the event directors and scoring
authorities (countrydancedirector.com) have been used as input to the CTST Points database.
