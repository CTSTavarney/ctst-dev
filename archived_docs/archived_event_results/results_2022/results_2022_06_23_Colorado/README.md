Thanks, Kelly.

The Novice contest had a 2-round prelim with 9 leaders and 18 followers total. I took videos of all the prelim dances, so I'll mark that as Tier 1 for the leaders, and Tier 2 for the followers.

    John -

    I have results from CCC 2022. These were finals. Novice was either straight to finals or we just cut a few (so a low tier event). The others were straight to finals.

    I don't have 2023, Ed never sent them to us. Kay might request them but I am guessing Ed is busy too!
